Hi all,


This will be our first remote workshop, so please be sure that you have your equipment ready (headphones...). 

For this meeting we will use https://meet.jit.si/ . The main reason for that is that I don't want random people joining the meeting as it happen already in some of our meetings, neither to be spy by the Chinese Government (https://www.cnet.com/news/zoom-every-security-issue-uncovered-in-the-video-chat-app/). 

The installation of jit.si is quite easy you just need to install a plugin in chrome to make it work. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jitsi-meetings/kglhbbefdnlheedjiejgomgmfplipfeb/

The maximum number of people support is around 35. https://community.jitsi.org/t/maximum-number-of-participants-on-a-meeting-on-meet-jit-si-server/22273/2
Lets see how its goes, I expect 23 people.

Also to do the workshop is need it to install docker daemon in your computer. As I expect everybody using a mac (I suppose that if somebody use Linux, he/she knows how to do it and much more), and if you are using Windows, this workshop is not for you and format you pc please.

To install docker https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

Unfortunately this time we will not have pizza, but you can be in your house slippers when we are doing the workshop.

Cheers
